# TicketHub - Support App

## Overview:

Welcome to TicketHub, a project developed during the F5 Full Stack Bootcamp. The task at hand is to create the fundamental MVP of a ticket management application, allowing employees to submit requests to various departments, manage their queries, and store the data in a MySQL database. The software is designed with an object-oriented approach.

## MVP Features:

The MVP consists of a login view where users input their credentials, leading them to another view where they can make requests, edit them, and review their previous submissions. Technicians have the ability to manage and even delete tickets.

This project marks a significant milestone as the first venture into both frontend and backend development, culminating in the implementation of the initial CRUD operations.

For simplicity, both frontend and backend are consolidated within a single repository.

## Technologies:

### Frontend:
- Vue
- Axios
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Backend:
- Java

### Database:
- MySQL


## Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Vue CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @vue/cli
   ```
3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Axios:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
   
## Getting Started:

1. Start the backend by running the `AppApplication.java` file.
2. Once the backend localhost is obtained, initiate the frontend using:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
3. Ensure that the MySQL Workbench databases are operational.

Please follow this sequence to ensure the smooth operation of both frontend and backend. After these steps, open your browser and enjoy TicketHub by navigating to the provided localhost addresses.
